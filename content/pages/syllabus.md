Description
-----------

"Special Problems in Architectural Design" focuses on representation tools used by architects during the design process and attempts to discuss the relationship they develop with the object of design. **Representation** plays a key role in architectural design, not only as a medium of conveying and narrating a determined meaning or a preconceived idea, but also as a code of creating new meaning, while the medium seeks to establish a relationship with itself. In this sense, mediums of representation, as external parameters to the design process, are not neutral tools of translating an idea into its concrete form. They are neither authentic means of creativity, nor vapid carriers of an idea. Therefore, an important aspect in issues of meaning is how the architect manipulates the play of translating a concept to its concrete version, through the use of a medium of representation.

The course is a continuation of the equivalent course taught in the fall semester and specifically focuses on digital media, which have not only inundated design practice during the past decade, but have in many ways also redefined the design process and the creative means of the architect. The basic design tools being taught are Rhinoceros® 3.0 as a 3d modeling software and 3d Studio® Max 6 as a rendering software.

The course is intended to establish a reciprocal relationship with the design studio, feeding from and contributing to its content.

Finally, it is divided into three independent exercises.

*   Diagramming
*   House Analysis
*   Material Deployment Investigation
